# Latex

```tsx editor mode=preview
import {Latex, makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {createRef, waitFor} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const tex = createRef<Latex>();
  view.add(<Latex ref={tex} tex="{{y=}}{{a}}{{x^2}}" fill="white" />);

  yield* waitFor(0.2);
  yield* tex().tex('{{y=}}{{a}}{{x^2}} + {{bx}}', 1);
  yield* waitFor(0.2);
  yield* tex().tex(
    '{{y=}}{{\\left(}}{{a}}{{x^2}} + {{bx}}{{\\over 1}}{{\\right)}}',
    1,
  );
  yield* waitFor(0.2);
  yield* tex().tex('{{y=}}{{a}}{{x^2}}', 1);
});
```

The [`Latex`](/api/2d/components/Latex) component is used to show mathematical
formulas and animate them.

## Defining LaTex

You can specify the LaTex formula to show using the `tex` property. Similarly to
the [`Txt`](/api/2d/components/Txt) node, you can control the color and size of
the text using the `fill` and `fontSize` properties respectively.

:::caution

Make sure to always set some `fill` color otherwise nothing will be shown!

:::

```tsx editor
import {Latex, makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  view.add(
    <Latex
      // Try editing the formula below:
      tex="a^2 + b^2 = c^2"
      fill="white"
      fontSize={32}
    />,
  );
});
```

## Animating LaTex

We can animate LaTex by tweening the `tex` property. To enable deletion,
insertion and transformation animation you must split the formula into several
parts. You can do this by providing an array of strings:

```tsx
<Latex tex={['a^2', '+', 'b^2', '=', 'c^2']} />
```

Or by using the curly bracket (`{{}}`) syntax:

```tsx
<Latex tex="{{a^2}} + {{b^2}} = {{c^2}}" />
// equivalent to
<Latex tex={['a^2', '+', 'b^2', '=', 'c^2']} />
```

You can also mix both:

```tsx
<Latex tex={['{{a}}^2', '+',  '{{b}}^2', '=', '{{c}}^2']} />
// equivalent to
<Latex tex={['a','^2', '+', 'b', '^2', '=', 'c', '^2']} />
```

A tex part that only exists in the source formula is considered deleted and gets
faded out. Analogically, a part that only exists in the target formula is faded
in. Tex parts that exist in both the source and destination formulas will be
tweened:

```tsx editor
import {Latex, makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d';
import {createRef, waitFor} from '@motion-canvas/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const tex = createRef<Latex>();
  view.add(<Latex ref={tex} tex="{{1}} + {{2}}" fill="white" />);

  yield* waitFor(0.5);
  yield* tex().tex(['2', '+', '3', '+', '4'], 1);
});
```

If a given tex part occurs multiple times in the source and target formula, but
the number of occurrences does not match, the part will duplicated or merged.
You can see this in action in the example above. The formula starts with only
one plus sign (`+`), but ends with two.

## Common pitfalls

### Escaping slashes

The backslash character (`\`) is used as an escape character in JavaScript. In
order to use it as part of a LaTex formula, you need to escape it by doubling
it:

```tsx
node().tex('{{\\frac{1}{2}}}');
```

Note that this does not apply inside JSX string attributes:

```tsx
// No escape needed:
<Latex tex="{{\frac{1}{2}}" />
// Escape necessary:
<Latex tex={'{{\frac{1}{2}}'} />
```

### Missing spaces

As of right now, tex parts are put together by joining them with no separator.
This may break your formula if it depends on a space between two parts. For
example, the following formula will break:

```tsx
<Latex tex={['\\Delta', 'y']} />
```

The node will attempt to parse it as `\\Deltay` instead of the correct
`\\Delta y`. To prevent it, you should wrap the `y` part in curly brackets:

```tsx
<Latex tex={['\\Delta', '{y}']} />
```

This will be parsed as `\\Delta{y}` which is correct.
