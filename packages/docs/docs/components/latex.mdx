# LaTeX

The `Latex` component is used to show mathematical formula.

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{texSource}</CodeBlock>

<AnimationPlayer small name="tex" />

## LaTex Part

LaTex `tex` can be an array of string. The item of array can be called LaTex
part. Here the example:

```ts
tex(['a^2', '+', 'b^2', '=', 'c^2']);
```

LaTex `tex` can also be string. You can enclose the part of string using `{{}}`
to split tex into several part. Here the example:

```ts
tex('{{a^2}} + {{b^2}} = {{c^2}}']);
```

The first and second code result equal image. You can also use the syntax in
array item like this:

```ts
tex('{{a}}^2', '+',  '{{b}}^2', '=', '{{c}}^2']);
//equal to
tex(['a','^2', '+', 'b', '^2', '=', 'c', '^2']);
```

## Animating LaTex

We can animate LaTex by tweening `tex` propery. To enable deletion, insertion
and transformation animation you must split tex into several part.

Tex part that only exist in source tex is considered deleted and is animated
using fade in. Tex part that only exist in target tex is considered inserted and
is animated using fade out. Tex part that coexist in source and destionation tex
will be transformed from source to target.

When any part of the tex whose numbers in the source and target do not match,
all the part of the tex will be transformed (Number of tex greater than 0). For
example source has 2 `+` part and target has 3 `+` part, there no insertion,
instead second `+` part from source is transformed into second and third `+`
part from target.
