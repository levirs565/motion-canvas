# LaTeX

The `Latex` component is used to show mathematical formulas and animate them.

<AnimationPlayer banner name="tex" />

## Defining LaTex

You can set the LaTex formula to show by specifying `tex` property:

```ts
import {Latex} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components/Latex';

yield view.add(<Latex tex="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />);
```

LaTex `tex` property can be an array of strings. The item of the array can be
called LaTex part. Splitting LaTex into several parts is crucial for tweening.

```ts
yield view.add(<Latex tex={['a^2', '+', 'b^2', '=', 'c^2']} />);
```

Specifying LaTex using a string or array of strings will have equal result.
Below first code and the second code will have equal results.

You can also split Tex into several parts by enclosing part of a string using
`{{}}`

```ts
tex('{{a^2}} + {{b^2}} = {{c^2}}');
//equal to
tex(['a^2', '+', 'b^2', '=', 'c^2']);
```

You can also use this syntax in array items like this:

```ts
tex('{{a}}^2', '+',  '{{b}}^2', '=', '{{c}}^2']);
//equal to
tex(['a','^2', '+', 'b', '^2', '=', 'c', '^2']);
```

## Fill Color

To set the color of the Tex you can set `fill` property to any color you want.

:::note

You must set fill, if not Tex will not appear.

:::

## Font Size

To set the size of Tex you can set `fontSize` property. The size of this
component will be equal to the size of `Txt` component that has equal `fontSize`.

```tsx editor
import {Rect, Txt, Latex} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components';
import {makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/scenes';
import {createRef} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/utils';
import {createSignal} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/signals';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const fontSize = createSignal(48);
  view.add(
    <Rect layout direction="column" alignItems="center" gap="25px">
      <Latex tex="y = mx + c" fill="white" fontSize={fontSize} />
      <Txt fill="white" fontSize={fontSize}>
        Normal text
      </Txt>
    </Rect>,
  );

  yield* fontSize(24, 1);
  yield* fontSize(48, 1);
});
```

## Animating LaTex

We can animate LaTex by tweening `tex` property. To enable deletion, insertion
and transformation animation you must split Tex into several parts. When you do
not split Tex into several parts, only fade-in and fade-out animation will
happen.

```tsx editor
import {Latex} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components';
import {makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/scenes';
import {createRef, waitFor} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/utils';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const tex = createRef<Latex>();
  view.add(<Latex ref={tex} tex="1 + 2" fill="white" />);

  yield* waitFor(0.5);
  yield* tex().tex('2 + 3 + 4', 1);
});
```

The Tex part that only exists in source Tex is considered deleted and is
animated using fade-in. The Tex part that only exists in target tex is
considered inserted and is animated using fade out. Tex part that coexists in
source and destination Tex will be transformed from source to target.

```tsx editor
import {Latex} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/components';
import {makeScene2D} from '@motion-canvas/2d/lib/scenes';
import {createRef, waitFor} from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/utils';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const tex = createRef<Latex>();
  view.add(<Latex ref={tex} tex="{{1}} + {{2}}" fill="white" />);

  yield* waitFor(0.5);
  yield* tex().tex(['2', '+', '3', '+', '4'], 1);
});
```

When any part of the Tex whose numbers in the source and target do not match,
all the parts of the Tex will be transformed (Number of parts greater than 0). In
the example above, source has 1 `+` part and target has 2 `+` part, there no
insertion, instead a `+` part of source is transformed into first and second `+`
part of the target.
